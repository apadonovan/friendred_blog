Multi-media installation’s manifestation cannot be fixed, it differs from the original art which stay inside the frame, and also it has the multi-dimension, cross platform (web, installation, conceptual, hardware, software) and theoretical basis. The biggest distinction from the conventional art is that it breaks the space and time and make the spectator as part of the art, moreover ‘interactive’ became the core communication method between art work and audience.

In conclusion, multi-media installation art consists of three portions, the first one is “Object”, using the readymade object or raw materials to make artwork, such as Duchamp, fountain, to be more specific, he used readymade urinal as his object and give a special concept in it.

Moreover, the concept like “accumulation” is popular in the contemporary arts, for example, Ai Weiwei, Sunflower Seeds (Fig.1), he put several million sunflower seeds which were made of ceramics in the exhibition, spectators can walk or lie on these seeds, and the purpose of this work is that he pinned childhood memories on the sunflower seeds. Further more, the culture information and social information which the media contained are the most significant part of the artwork.

The second part is “Dream made”, Freud considers dream can be divided into three part, “primarily”, “a composite structure”, “Symbolical Function in Dream Semiology”, (Die Traumdeutung), consequently, in the multi-media installation arts, an extremely significant manifestation of installation art is making dream, for instance, Japanese artist, Chiharu Shiota, is a typical dream maker, all of her installation arts have a strong visual impact, such as “During Sleep” (Fig.2), she created a dreaming environment rather than reality it can activate audience. Further, the third one is “Sense”, and sense contains two main part, sense of visual and sense of space, this is because that installation art can walk from the 2-dimensional visual arts’ realm. Sometimes we can relate to sound and light, for example Olafur Eliasson’s work, “The weather project”, using monofrequency lights, projection foil, haze machines, mirror foil, aluminium and scaffolding and so on to make a ‘sunset’ scene, making the spectator lie in the ‘beach’ and feeling fantastic view. At the same time, the audience became a part of the work.

Thus, there is a close relationship between contemporary arts and installation arts. Nowdays, the tendency of arts are more Multi-media installation art challenge the grand narratives of what can be art, it refused the any can be the limitation of art manifestation and use a flexible method told spectators what art is.
