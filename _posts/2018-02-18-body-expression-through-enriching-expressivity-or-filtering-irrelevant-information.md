Most recently two experiences caught my eyes. One was an installation I experienced at Uncanny Valleys of a Possible Future, Physical Mind created by Teun Vonk, also exhibited in 2006 Ars Electronica. When body encountering pressure via gradually squeezed two inflatable objects, experiencer feels more released in contrary. Experiencer’s body surrounded by a relatively tight and secure space, inflexibility of the body actually increases the flexibility of the mind. Most of the information has been processed and filtered through habituation, our haptic, visible feedback or the other sensory feeling will be perceived in the hierarchy (Updating to Remain the Same — Habitual Media, Wendi Chun). Consequently, we will instead get more information when the irreverent data has been reduced.

Another example, The Chronarium, created by Loop.ph lab, exploring the sleeping problem through a haptic immersive environment.
