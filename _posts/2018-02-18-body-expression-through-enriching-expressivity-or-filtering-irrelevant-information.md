Most recently two experiences caught my eyes. One was an installation I experienced at Uncanny Valleys of a Possible Future, 'Physical Mind' created by Teun Vonk, also exhibited in 2006 Ars Electronica. In this piece, the body encounters pressure via being gradually squeezed by two inflatable objects, leading the experiencer to feel more released in contrary. The experiencer’s body is surrounded by a relatively tight and secure space, leading the inflexibility of the body to actually 'increase' the flexibility of the mind. Most of the information has been processed and filtered through habituation, our haptic, visible feedback or other sensory feelings will be perceived in the hierarchy (Updating to Remain the Same — Habitual Media, Wendi Chun). Consequently, we will instead get more information when the irrelevant data has been reduced.

Another example, The Chronarium, created by Loop.ph lab, exploring the sleeping problem through a haptic immersive environment.
