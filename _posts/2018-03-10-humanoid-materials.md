Comparing with the other actuators including motors, solenoid, electroactive polymer etc. used in multiple situations, for example hydraulic, pneumatic, magnetic or electrical demand, SMA is more “humanoid”. The heating transition from the martensite phase to the austenite phase is in a way more natural and quiet. Some aspects, training methods, the pseudo elasticity of the SMA made itself more compatible and flexible in the several areas. Also becoming costlier and limited in human interactive products and occasions.

To extend this thread, I was pondering the reason most people interested in the liveness of nonlife or the emergence of the life of nonlife. For example, Philip Beesley’s Radient Soil in 2003 compromised of plant-like architectural structures, in which plume-like structures reacted according to surrounding movements. It reminded me of carnivorous plants, representing a mesmerizing humanoid habit while “preying”. This can be regarded as underlying the analogy or the manifestation of the combination of synthetic and emotions.

What also impressed me was Silk Pavilion, exploring the relationship between digital and biological fabrication in design made by Neri Oxman in 2013 from MIT media lab. This work combined two worldviews together, one spins silk by the robotic arms, the other fills in the gaps. Non-liveness and liveness collaborate to build the product. As Neri said, “if the final frontier of design is to breathe like into products and the buildings around us to form a two-material ecology, then the designers must unite these two worldviews.”
