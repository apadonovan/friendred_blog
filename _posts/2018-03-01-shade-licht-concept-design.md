The main reason for light pollution are the excessive or obtrusive use of artificial lights, altering the natural state of ecosystems, as well as wasting significant amounts of energy. Some researchers have previously demonstrated light pollution as one of the most dramatic changes to the natural world stemming from human population growth and night time illumination on a global scale. Anthropogenic light pollution is caused by the scattering of artificial light reflected from most of the facades of infrastructures, vehicles and dust in the atmosphere. There could be several ways to improve this problem. I propose to mediate the perspective of reflection and refraction through constructing artificial shade for buildings. Along with alleviating light pollution, the ‘shade’ will be heated by solar rays during the day time and will change shape automatically to maximize absorbed heat from the sun. The thermal energy will then be converted into electricity to power the basic usage of electrical equipment within the building. During the nighttime, the shade will ‘remember’ the original shape which is flat against the exterior wall for absorbing the artificial lights effectively instead of reflecting into the atmosphere. The whole behavior of the shade is natural deformation without having to motorize the conjunction.

The picture (fig.1) shows different scales of the conceptual shade and scenario, it demonstrated construction scale, partial of construction scale, the shade scale and atomic scale separately from left to right.

This concept utilizes the recently developed darkest material, Vantablack, which is made of microscopic carbon nanotubes (fig.2). This material absorbs 99.96% of the light that hits its surface. The main feature of Vantablack is that it can bring up its surface temperature when absorbing natural light. We can utilize this characteristic of Vantablack as a possible power supply. When arranged appropriately, part of the power can be converted into electricity supporting the electrical demands of the building, whilst also providing part of the thermal energy used by itself for transforming the curvature (fig.3).

To achieve deformable shade, the idea would be to use shape memory materials, which have the ability to change shape and remember preformed shapes. This would be achieved utilizing 4D prints of Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) material. SMA has been exploited in various disciplines including medicine, robotics and infrastructure. Through combining the attributes of SMA such as pseudoelasticity, memory and deformation-training methods. The shade created by the shape memory alloy will be lighter than traditional actuators such as stepper motors, server motors and solenoids. I would coat the SMA with Vantablack to act as the convertible power supply of itself. During the day time when heated by solar rays, the shade will deform naturally and adjust curvature to be perpendicular with the solar rays. When temperature goes low especially at night, the shade will retrieve the normal status. At this time, its function would be to absorb the reflection and refraction of the city lights (Fig4).

With the combination of the SMA and Vantablack, the ubiquitous light pollution observed predominantly in cities can be ameliorated. This will fundamentally innovate peoples’ perception of green energy and will contribute to solving the problem of urban light pollution in the future. The diagram below elucidates the two statuses of the shade while attached to the building during a full day and night.

It’s so important to make people experience the information in a way that they feel connected with a vision, with a future and trigger thoughts of what else is possible and the importance of sustainability. The core concept of design is that you can fundamentally envision and inspire people’s views of the future and stimulate new creation and innovation. There are so many possibilities of why, what and how we can achieve.
