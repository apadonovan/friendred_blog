**Conception:**


The symbolic relationship between culture and technology has always been interesting to me. There is an unorthodox conversation between ethnographic convention and technology, via the analysis and interpretation of information into visuals and sound, allowing audiences to effectively experience the information. The minimalism, futurism and materiality existing in interactive experiences and processes can be explored by using various methodologies from different perspectives and domains.

I will combine Hmong society and rituals into a body commanding performance. Through researching the mythology, rituals, healing ceremonies and different modalities of arts in the Hmong tribe,. My aim is to create an audio based, interactive performance.

The Hmong religion is traditionally animist. In traditional Hmong practice, all animate and inanimate matter possesses life. The aim of this performance is to use unusual digital techniques to restore, deconstruct and reconstruct the manifesto of the ritual being represented by technology. Different cultures and religions have their own mythologies and rituals. Several topics will be covered, for example, ‘Moqiu’ (Fig.1), a ritual which Hmong people celebrate in May of the Lunar calendar to memorize the myth in which ‘Moqiu’ was built to communicate with the sun by ancestors to stop them suffering from catastrophe and pestilence.

The human body and technology extend the way how people perceive culture and ideology during performance. My aim is to combine these two parts of the world, ritual and technology to create a new-age ritual. In this project, the Moqiu is part of the core ritual from the Hmong culture symbolising the worship, therefore I extracted the attributes of the balance out of bean and demonstrate in my concept design.
