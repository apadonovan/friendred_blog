**Conception:**
<font size="2">

The symbolic relationship between *culture* and *technology* has always been interesting to me. I will describe how I plan to build on the unorthodox conversation between ethnographic convention and technology, via the analysis and interpretation of information into visuals and sound, allowing audiences to effectively experience the information. Moreover, I will explore the minimalism, futurism and materiality existing in interactive experiences and processes, by using various methodologies from different perspectives and domains.

I will combine Hmong society and rituals into a body commanding performance. Through researching the mythology, rituals, healing ceremonies and different modalities of arts in the Hmong tribe,. my aim is to create an audio based, interactive performance.

The Hmong religion is traditionally animist. In traditional Hmong practice, *all animate and inanimate matter possesses life.* The aim of this performance is to use unusual digital techniques to restore, deconstruct and reconstruct the manifesto of the ritual being represented by technology. Different cultures and religions have their own mythologies and rituals. Several topics will be covered, for example, ‘Moqiu’ (Fig.1), a ritual which Hmong people celebrate in May of the Lunar calendar to memorize the myth in which ‘Moqiu’ was built to communicate with the sun by ancestors to stop them suffering from catastrophe and pestilence.

In a different cultural context, animism, which encompasses the beliefs that all material phenomenon has agency, can be presented by a different people in a different way. In the Hmong community as well as in other cultures such as Yi, Hani, Zhuang and etc. In this ritual, people will lean their waist on the side of the beam. Performers spin and jump using their tiptoes. This swing-like ritual behavior was used to symbolize the anticipation of Hmong to contact the deities.  Before the spiritual practice, a priest will produce the worship ceremony. Traditionally, they sprinkle liquor up, down, left and right, a this is necessary to revere and honor the sky, soil, ancestors and deities for guidance and protection. Pork will be piled in the intersection of two beams to intensify grating for gaining welfare and health of the living.

**Fabrication:**
<font size="2">
This piece ideally should be hanging on the ceiling, the stepper motor (Fig.5) on the top would control the ‘circle’ spin horizontally and the other two motors (Fig.2) on the side will be used to making the pipe (Fig.1) move vertically. The profile of the circle (Fig.3) is a ‘U’ shape, which LED strip can be put in the notch of the circle.
One of the biggest challenge is the fabrication of the installation, the material could be aluminium, plywood or acrylic. The idea material is aluminium, which economically more expansive than the plywood and technically harder to fabricate.
