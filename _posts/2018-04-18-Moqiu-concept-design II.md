I hope to investigate deeper the factors which influence the path of culture, such as costumes, makeup, instruments, ceremonies, convention, sacrifice, disease and exorcism. One of the ideas which came from ethnic internal instruments, Lusheng (Fig.1), a musical instrument with multiple bamboo pipes. I will redesign and digitize the instrument as well as adding new acoustic effects, for instance, adding haptic sensing to manipulate the pitch and frequency. In this way, the performer can increasingly extend the dimension of the gesture and musical instrument during the performance.

Technology can extend and characterize cultures in various modalities. The introduction of new age ritual or post ritual can, over time, morph to produce what we recognize as modern culture. Moreover, the purpose of this project will be to explore the ways in which ethnographic cultural identities can have fundamental influences on Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Overall, I aim to analyze how related aesthetic or functional cultural symbolization could contribute to the performing arts.
