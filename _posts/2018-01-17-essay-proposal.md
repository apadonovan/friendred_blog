##### Friendred Essay Plan 17/01/2018

**Essay Plan 2:**

1.	Introduction (750 words)
-	New interfaces for performance that explore the relationship between the performer and the machine.
-	Performance of materials themselves. That new materials have the potential to perform in humanoid ways, or at least ways that blur the boundary between the performance of a human and the performance of materials.
-	Humans become more machine like through the use of actuators.
-	New materials
-	Outline of the essay
-
2.	Methodology  (750 words)
-	The use of speculative art practice – to imagine new interfaces through engaging with new materials.
-	Practice – based art approach exploring materials for new interfaces on a small scale.

3.	Discussion of using new materials in developing performance based computational art (500 words)
-	Discuss the history of using new materials to develop performance and computational art. How artists have developed interesting interfaces that engineers might not have thought of!
-	Discussion of new materials.

4.	Survey of the field (1000 words) (based on literature review).

– other artists using new materials or developing interfaces to explore performance based computational art eg. Becky – and concluding that no one has used SMA.
Lots of people have used interfaces on the body

However they generally contribute to the device, they use the interface, future design direction would be more portable and achievable. They want it to be on the skin so that they can easily control it and use it as a communication to the device, making handy interface to do everyday computing. But instead I am interested in using new interfaces to expand the possibilities for the body in performance and the relationality between performers and machines.

5.	Case Study on the experiments with SMA, using the single wire. (1250 words
-	Introduce the reader to SMA
Show us its existing uses and the describe that instead I am interested in SMA interfaces to expand the possibilities for the body in performance and the relationality between performers and machines.
-
-	Describe its potentials for SMA to be used as an interface in performance and computation.
-	Describe your small experiments.
-
6.	Speculative Design (1000)
Describe the design you have worked on for a performance interface using SMA – description of how it would work, diagram and draws on the experiment with single wire. 3d animation of how it works.

OR

7.	Case Study  (1000) of performance practice that uses the qualities of an SMA interface but uses a different technology to achieve this.

8.	Conclusion (750)

**Essay Plan 1:**

Introduction
Methodology
Discussion of using sensors in developing performance based computational art
Discussion of the field – other artists using sensors to explore performance based computational art
Case Study on Baptism or Digital Trance
Conclusion
