# lighting
<font size="2">
so the problem of not lighting up, I am not absolutly sure yet, but it could be I used breadboard, nevetheless, I changed the pin which is supposeed to connect to the ground to the thicker wire and coennct to the terminal of the led strip directly, somehow it worked. Please remember that you tried to connect ground pin to the power supply negtive onece, it couldn't work
no the first LED strip will have the dimming effect from the beginning to the end.!

I used the same methord to connect the other lights, somehow it couldn't work as well! fantastic! Through my debug, I think the problem was either the connection of the wire of the data pin or I burned the resistor accidently. But I thought it was some problems like arduino ran out of memory.

it also too two days to put two lights strips in the structure
