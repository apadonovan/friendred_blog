In a different cultural context, animism, which encompasses the beliefs that all material phenomenon has agency, can be presented by a different people in a different way. In the Hmong community as well as in other cultures such as Yi, Hani, Zhuang and etc. In this ritual, people will lean their waist on the side of the beam. Performers spin and jump using their tiptoes. This swing-like ritual behaviour was used to symbolise the anticipation of Hmong to contact the deities.  Before the spiritual practice, a priest will produce the worship ceremony. Traditionally, they sprinkle liquor up, down, left and right, a this is necessary to revere and honour the sky, soil, ancestors and deities for guidance and protection. Pork will be piled in the intersection of two beams to intensify grating for gaining welfare and health of the living.

The human body and technology extend the way how people perceive culture and ideology during performance. My aim is to combine these two parts of the world, ritual and technology to create a new-age ritual. In this project, the Moqiu is part of the core ritual from the Hmong culture symbolising the worship, therefore I extracted the attributes of the balance out of bean and demonstrate in my concept design.
