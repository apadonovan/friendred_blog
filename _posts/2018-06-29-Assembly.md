<font size="2">
for the next step if I want to make a specific pattern, I can try to make all the lasrts point to a specific location (this could be used as a part of the performance, for example all the laser point folloing up the daners torso position). I could also try to make a more complex pattern out of ot as long as I have the way to make a single point tilt and pan to a specifi clocation. so I could maybe use noise function to manipulate it. Also, you can make them swap the position since they had a sibsific shape, like cross, like square. that would be crazy
