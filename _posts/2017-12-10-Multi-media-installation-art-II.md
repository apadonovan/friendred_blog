Multi-media installation’s manifestation cannot be fixed, it differs from original art which stays inside the frame, and also has a multi-dimension, cross platform (web, installation, conceptual, hardware, software) and theoretical basis. The biggest distinction from conventional art is that it breaks space and time to make the spectator part of the art, with ‘interactive’ becoming the core communication method between art work and audience.

In conclusion, multi-media installation art consists of three portions, the first one is the “Object”, using a ready made object or raw materials to make artwork, such as Duchamp, fountain. To be more specific, he used a ready made urinal as his object and then imposed a special concept onto it.

Moreover, “accumulation” is popular in the contemporary arts, for example, Ai Weiwei, in Sunflower Seeds (Fig.1), put several million sunflower seeds made of ceramics in the exhibition, allowing spectators to walk or lie on the seeds. The purpose of this work is that he pinned childhood memories on the sunflower seeds. Therefore, cultural information and social information which the media contained are the most significant part of the artwork.

The second part is “Dream made”, Freud considers that the dream can be divided into three parts, “primarily”, “a composite structure” and “Symbolical Function in Dream Semiology”, (Die Traumdeutung). Consequently, in the multi-media installation arts, an extremely significant manifestation of installation art is making a dream. For instance, Japanese artist, Chiharu Shiota, is a typical dream maker, all of her installation arts have a strong visual impact, such as “During Sleep” (Fig.2), in which she created a dreaming environment rather than reality to activate the audience. Further, the third one is “Sense”, and sense contains two main parts, sense of visual and sense of space, this is because that installation art can walk from the 2-dimensional visual arts’ realm. Sometimes we can sound and light, for example Olafur Eliasson’s work, “The weather project”, using monofrequency lights, projection foil, haze machines, mirror foil, aluminium and scaffolding and so on to make a ‘sunset’ scene, making the spectator lie in the ‘beach’ to look at a fantastic view. Once again this shows how, in installation art, at the same time, the audience becomes a part of the work.

Thus, there is a close relationship between contemporary arts and installation arts. Nowdays, the tendency of arts are more Multi-media. Installation art challenge the grand narratives of what can be art, it refused the limitation of art manifestation and uses a flexible method to show spectators what art is.
