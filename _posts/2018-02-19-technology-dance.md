Integrating technology into dance is a quite common phenomenon recently, as the technology development. There is an exquisite relationship between dancer, dancers’ body, choreography structure and intimate technology. The data from the body can be regarded as a raw material employed in a performance, for example, performers’ EEG, EMG, haptic, trajectory data so on and so forth. In the second part, I indented to depict another sort of expressivity instead of the one I wrote above, which fully enrich the expressivity by gestures. Hacking the Body2.0 is a research project about biosensors, wearables and performance by Kate Sicchio. It represented the data as a medium or massager transmitter connecting body and sensory environments. What audience perceive connected to the side of the environments and active body movements. On the other hand, what performers sensate the nuances of biologic information etc.

Technology in an efficient way bridging both perspectives during the performance, one is the parametric setting and algorithmic technology, the other is improvisational body mechanism. There is no equation or quantitative objects can be used to describe the accuracy of the wearable technology and the precision of the body movements. The gap paradoxically created the creativity, or a protocol to more comprehensively connect to, for instance, soundtrack, other data, the connection between performers and IoT.

When I see Flutter/Stutter, what quite fascinating to me is that the entanglement of movements or improvisation of the choreography are communicating with the wearable devices, ether conductive thread changing the capacity or the other sensors. Intertwined wearables within the improvisation are extended the spectrum of the expressivity of the body as well as limbs of the performers.

Soft Cell, a performance embodies mathematical model and biological ingredients. It inspired me that boundaries of filtering the irrelevant information and expressiveness can be jointed. Through physical limitation, the subtle safeness of the material is able to help performer experiencing a new dimension of improvisation yet enriching the connection between the audience and sensory environments via utilizing the technology.
