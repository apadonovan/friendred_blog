##Conception:
<font size="2">
The immersive space morphs and alters with light and becomes solid, its pressure composing and decomposing the self-awareness of skin. The dancer’s body is extended and manipulated as a conscious entity, exceeding the physiological object. The constant feedback between the body's trajectory and interaction with the environment changes the nature of the object itself.

## Fabrication:
## Circle structure
<font size="2">
This piece ideally should be hanging on the ceiling, the stepper motor (Fig.5) on the top would control the ‘circle’ spin horizontally and the other two motors (Fig.2) on the side will be used to making the pipe (Fig.1) move vertically. The profile of the circle (Fig.3) is a ‘U’ shape, which LED strip can be put in the notch of the circle.
One of the biggest challenge is the fabrication of the installation, the material could be aluminium, plywood or acrylic. The idea material is aluminium, which economically more expansive than the plywood and technically harder to fabricate.
