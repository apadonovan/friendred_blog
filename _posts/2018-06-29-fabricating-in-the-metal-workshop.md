##fabrication of the metal
<font size="2">
Fabricating metals, for now,  I fabricated the metal tructure consisted of two rings as well as the conjuctions of the rings, and top circle made by metal. via rolling machine, cutting, grinding, Plasma arc welding (PAW).
1. The next step is considering how to drill the whole of top and bottom to fix the MDF or acrylic board. The solution is using 16 mils self drilling / contour sunk screw, it doesn't work with 9mm, but it works with 6mm MDF board via testing
2. how to fix the motor holder on the side of the rings
3. how to find a way to connetc 18+ lasers holder onto the two rings without damage it
4. the conection between the nylon thread and motor spinning pin, I therefore used pulley to connect pin and thread (could be fine cored/ nylon, fish wire)
5. you might also need some wholes for the wires get out of the structure
6. polish and painting to avoid rust(for the polish I used grinder with different sharperness of the plan). The external circles comparally are easier to polish and grind, as the three different parts of the structure are different metal materials. However the cental disk is quite hard to grind, I guess I have to spay it by metallic paint.
7. In the endm due to a the difficuilties of the grinding, so I have to just spay it (smooth silver direct onto metal), the metal part was good, however the MDF part in order to retrive a smooth surface, thsu I had to sparay multiple times, still not sure about the the result

what's the next step!!!!
19th June--spend an day to drill the MDF and arcrylic board onto the structure, for the arcrylic, the frangibility of the material, so I had to drill a whole first, then use self drilling screws go through it.

##Wearable

the face maks are for two different performers, the mask ideally would be made out of matel structure and using the two day/see through mirror arcylic board, thus when performers are wearing it, the other side can reflects the lights, the side close to performer can see through
