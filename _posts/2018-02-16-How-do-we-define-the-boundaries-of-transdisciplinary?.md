The prefix trans is quite interesting for me, it is a good point to start with defining the definition of transdisciplinary arts. The genre of the arts can be varied, the way it is employed by artists is omnifarious. We always ponder the reasons as to why we live in an age which different disciplines can be widely penetrated and strongly projected into each other in transdisciplinary combinations. There could be multiple reasons, including the development of capitalism, economic crises, revolutions within contemporary arts as well as postmodern digital media demand.

We as transdisciplinary artists stand for across and beyond. The different core aspects of entities from different domains can be used as pigment and brushes to picture and question “novelty” itself. These entities can be juxtaposed independently or be the elements of the process by which the equilibrium of homogeneous is reached.

People defined these semantic terms to distinguish different disciplines and domains. The gaps in between, therefore, are born rationally as a hybrid race. New features exist within different identities, for instance, science, arts, computing, biology ethnography and choreography etc. One of my favorite transdisciplinary artists is Darren Johnston, who creates immersive environments, interacting with lights and body movements through integrated arts and technological approaches. An example of this is ‘Zero Point’, a performance created by Darren Johnston in 2014, which was created to represent a rebirth ritual utilising digital technology (Fig.1). Performers’ body and limbs control the boundaries projected by the projector. With body moving, the elements are mapped onto the body. The body’s dimension has been changed to represent the medium of zero point.

“Interdisciplinary embodies a crossover between several disciplines, we ought not to forget the connection between them might collapse.” This quote from Natalie P highlights that transdisciplinary arts are bounded ephemerally. Two disciplines might never meet again, but the addition of temporality acting as mutual attraction can be more powerful. Another Avant-garde transdisciplinary artist, Olafur Eliasson, who made The Weather Project in 2003, (Fig.2) bridged the connection between institution, society and other aspects of life. The most theoretical and fundamental aspect of this work is that he made uncertainties, specifically human beings, into the installation to help people perceive the weather. These works and others show that transdisciplinary methods can be the combination of countless mediums, such as media, engineering and fine arts etc.

The same is achieved by similar methods in Rain room (Random International, 2012) and Breathing Light (James Turrell, 2013), (Fig.4). There are numerous examples of artists using various methods to observe and perceive the world, but why? The diversity and attributes of the works can be extended via comparing ambivalence and absorbing counterparts. For example, chorography and architecture seem like completely different domains which hardly can be perceived in the same stage and can be encapsulated together. However, in 2016, Syuko Kato created a piece called Fabricating Performance: The Interaction of dance and construction. (Fig.3) She said “The analogue and digital notational systems for documenting choreographic movement provide promising alternative strategies for spatial design. These strategies overlap architectural design and dance choreography to explore reciprocal exchanges regarding the body, geometry and methods of spatial notation”. The architectural scale and spatial notion merged with choreography, were eventually represented by the topological and geometrical properties of the metal, extending both sides of the disciplines in combination.

Practitioners can bring different communities together, such as; scenography, performance, acoustics, lighting and engineering, to innovate and develop new interdisciplinary practices which manifest different perspectives and merits of each domain. This flexibility and uncertainty demonstrates the wide-ranging possibilities of different combinations, as well as magnifying the individual attributes of the disciplines themselves.
