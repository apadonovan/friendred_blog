Installation art was popular in the 70s in American, originating from the postmodernism, like minimalism, land art, and conceptual art, for instance, Marcel Duchamp, Fountain (Fig.1), to be more specific, Duchamp give urinal a new definition, which means that idea or concept is most important aspect of the art, regarding it as a fountain and making installation art went public. After that, installation art was a significant manifestation of contemporary art which is an active art category until now according to the media report and biennale in recent years. On the other hand, multi-media installation arts are still developing and perfecting continuously as a special category. In my viewpoint, “concept”, “space”, “technology” and “experience” are consisted of multi-media installation art. Hence, with these concept extending, multi-media installation art itself keep changing, besides, it is difficult to give a definition.

However, we can deconstruct installation art and can simply divide into three part, “object”, “space” and “people”, in terms of “object”, it can be anything, any mediums and materials, regarding as “space”, it can be a real space or virtual space. As for “people”, most of the installation arts need people involved and have an artificial portion in it, and the “people” can be artists themselves or spectators, subsequently, participators became the carriers of arts. If losing the participator, the artwork will not completion. Overall, installation art can be defined that one category of contemporary arts, mainly means special artificial artwork which made by the artist to express space, existence, sense and experience. Formally, installations arts’ production and exhibition are inside, if it played outside, it might be regarded as “public art”, “land art” or “intervention art”. Consequently, these arts did not have a specific border and most of the time integrate each other.

As for multi-media installation, it is focused on the integration of new media art and installation art, additionally, new media contains different branches, such as digital art, virtual art, interactive art, video games, 3D printing and art as biotechnology. Another, sometimes people named it Time-based media art, “contemporary art works that include video, film, slide, audio or computer-based technologies are referred to as time-based media works because they have duration as a dimension and unfold to the viewer over time.” Guggenheim museum defined that, which means that this concept makes art work become four dimensions as time and sense of participators involved, for example, Bill Viola’s video installation, The Crossing, he introduced “Two-channel colour video installation, with four channels of sound; 10 min,57 sec.” It seems like the video, sound, screen and projection are became the work itself. Bill Viola capture the behavior of human and water, using high-speed camera, no matter what the process or the exhibition, he usually creates artwork based on the technology. Another representative art work, Visitation, 2008, “Color High-Definition video in plasma display mounted on wall.” This piece of work exhibited in 798 art center in Beijing, Viola used the screen as the medium and there are two old female walking through water curtain with complicated countenance, one the one side of the water curtain, there are black and white, by contrast the other side is colorful, he seems like use contrast to express the life.
