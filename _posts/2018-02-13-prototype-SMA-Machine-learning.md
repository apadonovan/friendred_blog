Shape Memory Alloy(SMA) or muscle wire, has the ability to “remember” it's pre-deformed shape via thermal energy. The type I used here consists of 50% titanium and 50% Nickle. It has been used in many different domains including robotics, optometry, aircraft, telecommunication and dentistry etc. I am interested in the materiality of the shape memory material and the expressivity of body movements. Both of which can be elaborated as it's “performance”.

There is a philosophical word, hylozoism, which means all matter has life. How can I create a scene which is able to interpolate and inhabit both characteristics and attributes to maximize the verisimilitude and liveness? I then tried to bridge the connection between deformation training methods of Shape Memory Material (SMM) and machine learning algorithms (Neural Network) from hand gestures.

With gestures switching, SMA can be trained to remember the pre-deformed shape through parameterized electricity by hand gestures. I added some acoustic change while the different mode of gestures swapping to mimic the breath. There are 6 small LEDs are used while gesture changing to differentiate moving state.
